# Technology

For tech, our modpack is built around:

- [Applied Energistics](#applied-energistics)
- [Create](#create)
- [Immersive Engineering](#immersive-engineering)
- [ComputerCraft](#computercraft)
- [Extreme Reactors](#extreme-reactors)

We did our best to integrate them with each other as nicely as possible.

## Applied Energistics

See [the Applied Energistics 2 guide](https://appliedenergistics.org/guides).

## Create

The [Create fandom wiki](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Getting_started) has some information.

We included [_Create Crafts & Additions_](https://modrinth.com/mod/createaddition) so Create can bridge between electricity and kinetic energy,.
which lets you use Create to power other tech mods.

There is integration between Create and the following mods:
- Ender Storage
- Farmer's Delight
- Ars Nouveau
- Sophisticated Backpacks
- Iron's Spells & Spellbooks

We also added the folllowing Create-related mods:
- _Create: Enchantment Industry_, for automating enchanting
- _Create: Copycats+_
- _Create: Escalated_, to add escalators
- _Create: Hypertubes_, so you can pretend this is Satisfactory
- _Create: Metalwork_
- _Create: Mob Spawners_


These aesthetic/visual mods are also in the modpack:
- Create Deco
- Create Encased


## Immersive Engineering

Immersive Engineering provides its own in-game guide, called the _Engineer's Manual_.

You can craft a book and a lever to make it.

## ComputerCraft

We technically use _CC: Tweaked_, which provides [online documentation](https://tweaked.cc/).

## Extreme Reactors

The [Extreme Reactors page on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/extreme-reactors) implies the lack of information is intentional.
