Car go vroom. Car go more vroom on road (I think).

<!--Our Aura fuel station currently provides fuel for free.
Oil donations are greatly appreciated, as they allow us to keep fuel free.-->

puppy is going to try adding some free fuel stations. let them know if you have a specific location or a general area you'd prefer!

## Building A Car

You need a Workshop to build a car.

A "workshop" consists of one "Car Workshop" block with 8 "Car Workshop Parts" around it.

### Components

Cars need:

- 1x vehicle body
- 1x engine (3 cylinder, 6 cylinder, or truck)
- 1x tank (small, medium, or large)
- 4x wheels

A battery will probably make it work better.

## Repairs & Maintenance

The required tools are:
- Wrench (car:wrench)
- Screw Driver
- Hammer

## Fuel Production

Fuel is produced using Immersive Engineering technology.

- Sedans and sports cars can only use gasoline.
- Transporters can use gasoline, diesel, and biodiesel

It is worth noting that Transporters run more efficiently on diesel and biodiesel. (I think? This might be outdated.)

## Roads

If you have some places you want connected via road, let puppy know.
