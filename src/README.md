The _Advanced Colonies_ modpack is built around _MineColonies_, while trying to
provide a well-integrated variety of technology, magic, nature, and transportation mods.

**This guide is VERY MUCH a work in progress, it probably has mistakes!**

You can view the map at [map.canine.systems](https://map.canine.systems/).

## Getting Started

If you don't haven't joined before, this is how to set it up:

1. Download and install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
2. Run Prism Launcher
3. [Drag this link to the main Prism Launcher window][modpack-download]
4. Click "OK"
5. Launch the "advanced-colonies" instance and connect to the server
6. When it asks if you want to download an external modpack, click "Download"
7. When it asks to restart Minecraft, click "Yes, close the game"
8. Launch Minecraft and connect again

There is a YouTube video of what steps 3-8 looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtXHjBzdpQ4

(Video is slightly outdated, I'll make a new one soon.)
