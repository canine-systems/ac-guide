TODO: Verify all of this is still accurate.

Here at Canid Motors, a subsidiary of Canine Systems, our goal is to lower the barrier of entry to having a car.

To that end, we provide the following services in the Aura area:

- fuel stations
- auto repair shop

And will soon be providing:
- road construction and maintenance (WIP)

We will discuss each of these in this chapter.
