# Crafting &amp; Recipes

## Crafting Station

_Advanced Colonies_ includes the [Crafting Station](https://modrinth.com/mod/crafting-station-jei-edition-updated), which:

- keeps your items stored
- displays items in it on top
- can access neighboring inventories

## Crafting Interface Additions

The [Crafting Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/crafting-tweaks) mod adds some features to call crafting tables (including the Crafting Stations):

- button to rotate the crafting grid
- button to balance the crafting grid stacks to be even sizes (or as close as possible)
- button to clear crafting grid items into your inventory
- holding "w" while clicking an item will transfer an item (shift+w transfers all of type)
- right click the result slot to craft a full stack

## Recipe Conflicts

If there are multiple recipes with the same input, the [_Polymorph_](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymorph) mod allows you to switch between the various outputs.

## Unified Resources

If multiple mods add the same resource (e.g. copper ingots), [_Almost Unified_](https://modrinth.com/mod/almost-unified) makes sure they're consolidated.

## Supplementaries

Additional recipes are provided by the [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries) and [Supplementaries Squared](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries-squared) mods.

## Custom Recipes

We use CraftTweaker to add the following recipes:
